Utility Materials is a New York-based company specializing in technical workwear and industrial equipment for energy infrastructure professionals. This theme is built with the same no-nonsense, field-ready sensibility: dense materials, high contrast, and a controlled accent for the signal, not the noise.

## Install (local)
1. Copy this folder into your vault at `.obsidian/themes/`.
2. In Obsidian, go to `Settings -> Appearance -> Themes` and select `Utility Materials`.

## Font
This theme expects `Monaspace Krypton Frozen Medium` to be [installed locally](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace). If it is not installed, it will fall back to other Monaspace faces or `monospace`.
